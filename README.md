# image-patternator
A short python program for tiling images with halftone-like effects.

## Usage
Run the main python file from a terminal. On Windows, this may require to have downloaded the python executable.
"Grid size" is the size of a tile, in pixels. All tiles are always square. The number should depend on the size of the details you want to conserve. 
If the resulting image looks too blocky, or nothing like the original image, try again with a lower grid size.
